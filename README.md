# webcrawlerT
The project scrapes information about books from the flipkart website - Title , description and ratings and stores in a json file.

Steps to follow :

1. Load the library selenium using pip install -U selenium from your command prompt
2. Load the library beautiful soup using pip install beautifulsoup4
3. Create an empty bookdetails.json file in the folder where you have stored the file webcrawl.py
3. Run the file webcrawl.py - it opens up a browser (here I have used chrome - you could use any web browser of your choice) and starts scraping the information. 
4. The empty bookdetails.json file now has all the information about the books.
