The protagonist of the story, a young Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, is plagued with recurring dreams, wherein a mysterious child urges him to look for buried treasure at the base of the Egyptian pyramids. Determined, he leaves Spain and heads towards Egypt. En route, he meets the King of Salem, a man named Melchizedek.

This could be highly useful while taking down lectures and speeches and in other situations.\n\n\tThere were shorthand systems in use before Pitman's, but his system was much more streamlined and organized so it became highly popular throughout the English speaking world.\n\n\tThe Pitman shorthand system is phonetic and the emphasis is on consonants rather than on the vowels. Vowels are optionally represented by small shapes like dots and dashes besides the main strokes.\n\n\tThe strokes themselves can be slightly varied to convey different sounds and even words. For instance, the thin stroke that looks like an open bracket '(' represents the sound 'th' as in think, or thank, and it can also represent these common words as a whole. The thick '(' can be used as a notation for the words they, them etc, and it also represents the sound of 'th' as it sounds in these words.\n\nPitman Shorthand Instructor And Key comprehensively covers all the basic strokes used in Pitman shorthand. It begins by looking at the symbols for consonants and vowels and discusses positioning, grammalogues, alternative representations for some letters, circle s and z and stroke s and z and so on.\n\n\tThe latter parts of the book covers topics like the halving principles and the doubling principles, prefixes, suffixes and termination, and medical semicircle. The book then goes into advanced topics like advanced phraseography, business and political,phrases, special contractions, note taking and transcription.\n\n\tThe book also provides a list of industry related phrases - banking and stockbroking phrases, insurance, railway and technical phrases.\n\nPitman Shorthand Instructor And Key ends with a chapter that illustrates shorthand in practice. It has a useful appendix section providing outlines for the names of some cities and towns, and grammalogues arranged alphabetically and then phonetically. It also provides a special list of contractions.\n\n\tThe book exhaustively covers the Pitman shorthand system. It can be a study guide for new users, while also serving as a reference for those who already use the system.\n\nAbout Isaac Pitman\n\n\tIsaac Pitman was a teacher.\n\n\tHis Pitman Shorthand system has proved to be one of the most enduring forms of taking shorthand notes in English. Isaac Pitman was born in 1813, in England. He was an ardent advocate of spelling reforms and supported the idea of phonetic spelling. His interest in language and spelling reforms led him to develop a phonetic shorthand system.\n", "Rating": "4.3"},

{"Name": "Born to Run\u00a0\u00a0(English, Hardcover, Springsteen Bruce)", "Description": "THE NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER 'Writing about yourself is a funny business...But in a project like this, the writer has made one promise, to show the reader his mind. In these pages, I've tried to do this.' -Bruce Springsteen, from the pages of Born to Run In 2009, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performed at the Super Bowl's halftime show. The experience was so exhilarating that Bruce decided to write about it. That's how this extraordinary autobiography began. Over the past seven years, Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life, bringing to these pages the same honesty, humour and originality found in his songs. He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey, amid the poetry, danger and darkness that fuelled his imagination, leading up to the moment he refers to as 'The Big Bang': seeing Elvis Presley's debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band. With disarming candour, he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work, and shows us why the song 'Born to Run' reveals more than we previously realized. Born to Run will be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen, but this book is much more than a legendary rock star's memoir. This is a book for workers and dreamers, parents and children, lovers and loners, artists, freaks or anyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and roll. Rarely has a performer told his own story with such force and sweep. Like many of his songs ('Thunder Road', 'Badlands', 'Darkness on the Edge of Town', 'The River', 'Born in the U.S.A.', 'The Rising', and 'The Ghost of Tom Joad', to name just a few), Bruce Springsteen's autobiography is written with the lyricism of a singular songwriter and the wisdom of a man who has thought deeply about his experiences.", "Rating": "4.7"},

He highlights materials, location and purpose as the three pillars of architecture.\n\n\tRoark ultimately works for disgraced architectural legend Henry Cameron in New York.

Roark starts his own office, but finally lands up at a granite quarry owned by Guy Francon. The novel is also the story of Dominique Francon with whom Roark has a physical and emotional battle throughout the novel.\n\nThe Fountainhead is an intriguing look at hypocrisy through Roark\u2019s anonymous designs that spur Keating\u2019s success.

It has a huge number of characters and none of them are perfect. The negative characters have positive attributes too, and the heroes also have flaws.

It also examines the ambiguities in the choices made by characters when faced with a dilemma, the hazy line that divides the good and the bad.\n\nThe Mahabharata focuses a lot on Dharma and whenever there is a transgression of an ethical code, the story pauses and the incident is thoroughly analyzed by various characters.\n\nAbout Gurcharan Das\n\n\tGurcharan Das is an author and columnist.\n\n\tHe is also the author of India Unbound, The Elephant Paradigm, and A Fine Family.\n\n\tGurcharan Das was born in 1943.

The other schoolboys make fun of him for being unable to understand the code of behavior, and the intelligent but apprehensive young Stephen feels alienated. At home he sees his family being split by discord over the social, political, and religious tensions in Ireland concerning Charles Stewart Parnell. Stephen soon begins to question which social institutions he can trust. When his family moves to Dublin because of their debts, he leaves his Clongowes and finds a new place at Belvedere College. He begins to outshine the other students and soon becomes a class leader. He wins some money at the college and squanders it on prostitutes, distancing himself from his father. Semi-autobiographical in nature, James Joyce\u2019s novel speaks of his own journey towards aestheticism and how he learnt the value of art. The language is particularly unique as it matures with Stephen himself, the first lines describing the journey of a moocow and the last progressing towards Stephen\u2019s love for beauty and art. Joyce\u2019s style emerges early, and hints at the juggernaut of fiction that he becomes through his later novels in this debut.\n\nAbout James Joyce\n\nJames Augustine Alyosius Joyce was an Irish writer and poet. He spearheaded the the modernist avant-garde of the early 20th century and is best remembered for Ulysses, Dubliners and Finnegan\u2019s Wake.\n\n\tThe current title was adapted into a feature length film in 1977 starring Bosco Hogan as Stephen Dedalus and T. P. McKenna as Simon Dedalus. The novel is considered to be an example of a K\u00fcnstlerroman in modernist style.\n", "Rating": "4.5"},

A work of romantic fiction, Sense and Sensibility is set in southwest England in 1792, and portrays the life and loves of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. The sisters are starkly different from each other; Elinor is the epitome of prudence and self-control while Marianne embodies emotion and enthusiasm.\n\n\tThe essential theme of the novel is the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. How both the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure.\n", "Rating": "5"},

Salinger is a coming-of-age novel that explores the themes of rebellion, independence, and identity, through the adventures of a teenage boy.\n\nSummary Of The Book\n\n\tHolden Caulfield is the protagonist of The Catcher In The Rye. He is portrayed by Salinger as a boy who is lazy and uncertain about his future. The story begins at Pencey Preparatory school, at which Holden is a student. In this first-person narrative, Holden describes life at this preparatory school as phoney, artificial, and dreary. After receiving yet another set of inadequate grades, he is expelled from the school. In an effort to 'find himself', Holden decides to head to New York City, where he heads underground. He narrates his adventures there in a 3-day flashback, which forms the basis of Salinger\u2019s story.\n\n\tIn New York City, Holden encounters a variety of experiences and adventures which bring him along on his path to self discovery. For instance, he encounters three women in their thirties, who dance and flirt with him. After observing what he assumes is a sex scene through a hotel window, Holden decides to invite a prostitute to his room. Adding to his 'adventures' are experiences with nuns, wayward taxi drivers, alcohol, and drugs. As Holden sinks deeper and deeper into this debaucherous lifestyle, a chance meeting with his sister Phoebe supplies Holden with just enough affection to yank him out of his 'madness'.\n\n\tThe frequent use of profanity and colloquialism by Salinger adds an element of realism to the characters, and is indicative of 'teenage behaviour'. The book promises to be an inspirational read for teenagers and adults alike who are facing or have faced similar mountains.\nThe Catcher In The Rye was originally published in 1951.

{"Name": "The Fountainhead\u00a0\u00a0(English, Paperback, Rand Ayn)", "Description": "\nThe Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is a gripping narrative that upholds the downfall of collectivism at the altar of the fiery human spirit and individualism.\n\nSummary Of The Book\n\nThe Fountainhead revolves around the dynamic protagonist Howard Roark, who defies collectivism with his own brand of philosophy and architecture. He takes a firm stand against worshipping tradition and embraces his own modern art forms. Roark gets expelled from architecture school owing to his non-adherence to conventional guidelines. Roark starkly defies history in favor of a more utilitarian outlook. He highlights materials, location and purpose as the three pillars of architecture.\n\n\tRoark ultimately works for disgraced architectural legend Henry Cameron in New York. At the same time, The Fountainhead also tells the story of Peter Keating, a perfect foil to Roark. Keating holds a job at the renowned Francon & Heyer firm, where he eventually lands a partnership on account of his flattery. Roark starts his own office, but finally lands up at a granite quarry owned by Guy Francon. The novel is also the story of Dominique Francon with whom Roark has a physical and emotional battle throughout the novel.\n\nThe Fountainhead is an intriguing look at hypocrisy through Roark\u2019s anonymous designs that spur Keating\u2019s success. Eventually Gail Wynand becomes Roark\u2019s friend and patron. Roark even goes to trial for dynamiting a building, the designs of which were changed.\n\tThe manuscript of The Fountainhead was shunned by twelve publishing houses and when finally published, went on to sell in excess of six and a half million copies globally. It was also the subject of a 1949 film, the screenplay of which was written by Rand.\n\nAbout Ayn Rand\n\n\tAyn Rand was an American screenwriter, playwright, philosopher, political activist and best selling novelist. She received worldwide acclaim for Objectivism, her own philosophical system and her firebrand ideologies.

{"Name": "The Brothers Karamazov\u00a0\u00a0(English, Paperback, Fyodor Dostoevsky)", "Description": "The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky's crowning achievement, is a tale of patricide and family rivalry that embodies the moral and spiritual dissolution of an entire society (Russia in the 1870s). It created a national furor comparable only to the excitement stirred by the publication, in 1866, of Crime and Punishment. To Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov captured the quintessence of Russian character in all its exaltation, compassion, and profligacy. Significantly, the book was on Tolstoy's bedside table when he died. Readers in every language have since accepted Dostoevsky's own evaluation of this work and have gone further by proclaiming it one of the few great novels of all ages and countries.", "Rating": "4.6"},

The contemplative novel drapes the tale of the rise and fall of Macondo and magically captures the life and times of the Buendia family over seven generations.\n\nSummary Of The Book\n\n\tSet in a fictional town called Macondo in Northern Colombia, One Hundred Years Of Solitude begins with Jose Arcadio Buendia leaving his hometown with his wife Ursula, in search of a better life. One night during their journey, they happen to camp at a riverside where Jose dreams about a spectacular city and decides to establish one on the same riverbank. Thus, he builds Macondo and slowly shapes it into how he wants a city to be.\n\n\tMacondo then begins to miraculously attract unusual people and extraordinary events that make for a gripping plot. The adventurous Buendias find themselves in the middle of some of the most historically potent circumstances in Colombia. As the lineage stands in the face of the glory and downfall of a civilization, Marquez's lyrical magic manifests the delicate nuances of love and war, youth and senility, and passion and lust. And finally, what had started as an innocent dream of Jose, Ursula and 19 other families gradually break down and fall prey to lawless anarchy.\n\nOne Hundred Years Of Solitude also chronicles the political and economic developments of the 19th century Colombia, such as corruption and capitalism with a touch of fiction. In a deeply touching and thought provoking non-linear narrative, Marquez paints a hundred years of history on the canvas of time. He uses his prerogative of having witnessed the wave of the Colombian revolution to graphically depict its lasting influence. He arrests in prose, the magical realism surrounding life, death, peace and the truth of mankind.\n\n\tWritten originally in Spanish, One Hundred Years Of Solitude was published first in 1967.

He married Mercedes Barcha in 1958. Known to have started the Magical Realism theme in fiction, Marquez's works mainly revolve around the motifs of solitude and the Latin American experience. Recognized across the globe as one of the prominent writers of the 20th century, Marquez has created a legacy in the Latin American Literary Boom.\n", "Rating": "4.5"},

He is portrayed by Salinger as a boy who is lazy and uncertain about his future. The story begins at Pencey Preparatory school, at which Holden is a student.

Adding to his 'adventures' are experiences with nuns, wayward taxi drivers, alcohol, and drugs. As Holden sinks deeper and deeper into this debaucherous lifestyle, a chance meeting with his sister Phoebe supplies Holden with just enough affection to yank him out of his 'madness'.\n\n\tThe frequent use of profanity and colloquialism by Salinger adds an element of realism to the characters, and is indicative of 'teenage behaviour'.
